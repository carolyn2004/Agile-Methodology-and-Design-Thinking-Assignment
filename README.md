# Agile-Methodology-and-Design-Thinking-Assignment ü§ù
  - The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases.
  - This assignment tested my understanding of agile and scrum principles and execution of scrum processes. It was my first time using the software Jira.
  - Attained A for this module. 
  - I was tasked to propose a website that would solve an issue currently occuring in Singapore. 
  - I decided to propose a web application that will recommend study areas to users for those people in Singapore that might not have a condusive environment to study at home during Covid 19. During Covid 19, there was a rise in work from home and students taking online classes. Student with multiple family members might have to share rooms and even devices. There could be wifi issues since multiple people are using the wifi at once. Hence, this application would be able to solve those issues by recommending places near the homes of the users that have ammeneties for them to use when studying. 
  - The website will allow users to leave reviews and rating on the respective study areas. Users can thumbs up and down a review to indicate if it was helpful/reliable. 
  - There is a  crowd level API and a map API for users to interact with and use on the page displaying more information about each study area. 
  - There is also a feedback form for users to express their opinion regarding the website.
  - There is a location filter for users to filter study area and find the ones closest to their homes. There is also a search bar for user to search for specific study area.
  -  Lastly, there is an about page with more details about how they website was started.
  - The high fidelity prototype shown in the report attached above is the final website I came up with on adobe XD across 5 seperate sprints.
