# Agile-Methodology-and-Design-Thinking-Assignment ü§ù
  - The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases.
  - This assignment tested my understanding of agile and scrum principles and execution of scrum processes.
  - Attained A for this module. 
  - I was tasked to propose a website that would solve an issue currently occuring in Singapore. 
  - I decided to propose a web application that will recommend study areas to users for those people in Singapore that might not have a conducive environment to study at home. 
  - The website will allow users to leave reviews and rating on the respective study areas. Users can thumbs up and down a review to indicate if it was helpful/reliable. 
  - There is a  crowd level API and a map API for users to interact with and use on the page displaying more information about each study area. 
  - There is also a feedback form for users to express their opinion regarding the website.
  -  Lastly, there is an about page with more details about how they website was started.
  - The high fidelity prototype shown in the report attached above is the final website I came up with on adobe XD across 5 seperate sprints.
